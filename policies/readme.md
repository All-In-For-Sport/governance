# ☑️ Policy Registry

The Policy Registry serves as the central index for all governance standards and operational procedures across All In For Sport's domains. Created by Community Governance and maintained by delegated entities, these policies provide transparency into decision-making processes, establish accountability frameworks, and ensure consistent application of rules.&#x20;

By organizing policies into distinct domains with clear ownership and update procedures, the registry enables both autonomy for operational teams and oversight by the broader DAO community.

### Purpose

The Policies Registry serves as:

* A transparent index of all policies governing DAO and operational activities
* A framework for accountability of delegated governance responsibilities
* A reference for consistent decision-making across the DAO

### Policy Domains

AIFS policies are organized into domains, each with specific governance delegations and oversight structures:

#### Administrative Policies

Administrative policies govern the procedural aspects of DAO operations and are typically created by Community Governance and maintained by delegated groups.

* [Governance Policies](governance/) - Standards for proposal processes, voting, and DAO state updates
  * [Voting Policies](governance/voting.md) - Rules and procedures for proposal submission and voting
  * [State Update Policies](governance/state/) - Guidelines for updating the DAO state repository

#### Operational Policies

Operational policies govern the day-to-day functioning of AIFS's working groups and initiatives. These policies are maintained by Operational Governance within parameters established by Community Governance.

_Note: Operational Policies section is currently in development._

### Policy Development and Updates

Each policy domain follows specific procedures for updates:

* **Creation of Policy Domains**: New policy domains are established through Community Governance
* **Governing Constraints**: Community Governance maintains key constraints for each policy domain
* **Policy Management**: Day-to-day policy management is delegated to appropriate groups:
  * Administrative Policies: Managed by the Governance CELL
  * Operational Policies: Managed by Operational Governance through CELL structures

### Transparency and Accountability

All policies, regardless of domain, are publicly available in this registry to ensure:

* Transparency in decision-making processes
* Accountability of delegates to their governance responsibilities
* Accessibility of standards to all DAO participants
* Consistent application of rules across the DAO

Updates to policies are documented in the DAO State Changes registry.
