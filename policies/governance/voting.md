# Proposal Voting Policy

## How to make a proposal to the DAO

All DAO members can create proposals for consideration by the DAO. To be considered, your proposal must meet certain [requirements](voting.md#proposal-requirements), and must be submitted to the [governance forum](https://discuss.allinforsport.org) for discussion prior to voting.

Please refer to these instructions, and/or reach out to the governance team for assistance with your proposal.

### Proposal Review Process

1. **Notification & Questions:**\
   \
   When you've written a **rough draft** of your proposal, create a post in the "Upcoming Proposals" discussion space with a link to your draft.\
   \
   Proposal authors are encouraged to answer all questions related to their proposal. Consider clarifying the language of your proposal in response to these questions.\

2. **Community Feedback (RFC):** \
   \
   Once you've completed the **first draft** of your proposal, create a post in the "Request for Comment" discussion space containing the full text of your proposal. Be sure to include your proposal number for reference (e.g., "AIFSIP-01: ...")\
   \
   Proposal authors are expected to participate in discussion and constructive debate regarding their proposal and are encouraged to include quality suggestions in their proposal language.\
   \
   \- The _recommended_ feedback period is 7 days.\
   \- The **minimum** feedback period is 3 days.\

3. **Sponsorship & Voting:** \
   \
   Once you are satisfied with the language of your proposal and have prepared your **final draft**, ping a member of the governance team to notify them that your proposal is ready for vote. **All compliant proposals will be sponsored without exception.**\
   \
   Alternatively, you can submit the proposal to Snapshot yourself if you meet the voting space requirements.\
   \
   \- The _recommended_ voting period is 7 days.\
   \- The **minimum** voting period is 4 days.\
   \
   Proposals which do not meet the minimum feedback and voting period requirements will be considered invalid.

## Voting Space Parameters

### Acceptance Threshold

Proposals must receive **51%** favorable votes to be accepted into the DAO state. Proposals which receive less than this amount will be considered [failed proposals](voting.md#proposal-retry-period).

#### Quorum

The quorum parameter for the [voting space](https://vote.allinforsport.org/) is **25%** of all voting badges. Proposals which do not receive enough votes will be considered invalid, regardless of their pass/fail outcome.

Proposals to reduce the quorum parameter by no more than 10% may be exempt from the quorum requirement, but only the event of governance breakdown due to repeated failure of proposals to meet quorum while also exceeding the acceptance threshold.

#### Proposal Retry Period

Failed proposals may be re-submitted for vote after 60 days, and only if significant changes are made to the proposal text in response to feedback shared in the discussion forum. Failed proposals may not be submitted in their original (failed) state.
