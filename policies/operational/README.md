# Operational Policies

The Operational Policy Domain contains policies, procedures, and standards that govern the autonomous activities of the AIFS Operations Group and its constituent cells. Established through AIFSIP-04, this domain represents a distinct sphere of authority within All In For Sport's two-house governance model.

### Purpose

The Operational Policy Domain serves as:

* A framework for autonomous execution of projects aligned with AIFS's purpose
* A clear delineation of authority between community governance and operational activities
* A record of transparent policies governing operational cells and their activities
* A structure for coordinating operational activities across autonomous teams

### Policy Development and Updates

Operational Policies are developed and maintained by the AIFS Operations Group within the constraints established by Community Governance. These policies focus on effective execution rather than strategic direction, which remains under community purview.

* **Creation of Operational Policies**: New operational policies are established through the AIFS Operations Group governance process
* **Policy Management**: Day-to-day operational policy management is delegated to the Operations Group
* **Community Boundaries**: Operations policies must respect the constraints and boundaries established in AIFSIP-04

### Administrative Organization

All In For Sport delegates administration of operational activities to [SuperBenefit](https://superbenefit.org/), where the AIFS Operations Group conducts its day-to-day activities as a SuperBenefit Project.

#### Recognized Smart Contracts

The designated smart contract for the AIFS Operations Group is a Safe Multisig located on Optimism:

* `0xb4409fb4eA8374e2590266Bac51dF3F9756d1D51`

#### Recognized Role Badges

Official recognition within the AIFS Operations Group requires appropriate role badges:

* Operations Group Badge: [AIFS Operations Group](https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/trees/10/78?hatId=78.3)
* Contributor Badge: [AIFS Contributor](https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/trees/10/78?hatId=78.1.6)

## Operational Policy Registry

### Community-Derived Policies

The following policies were established by Community Governance through AIFSIP-04 and must be followed by all operational contributors, projects, and governance bodies at All In For Sport:

**Recognized Smart Contracts**

> "**Policy:** Only a governance contract or multisig which holds the official [AIFS Operations Group](https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/trees/10/78?hatId=78.3) role badge will be recognized as the Operational Governance body:
>
> * Optimism NFT Contract: `0x3bc1A0Ad72417f2d411118085256fC53CBdDd137`
> * Token ID: `78.3`
>
> Community governance has the right to set eligibility requirements for the Operations Group role badge by installing a [Hats eligibility module](https://docs.hatsprotocol.xyz/hats-integrations/eligibility-and-accountability-criteria)."

**Contributor Eligibility**

> "**Policy:** Operational contributors, to be included in community governance as members of the DAO, must possess a [Contributor role badge](https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/trees/10/78?hatId=78.1.6).
>
> Operational cells are encouraged to adopt the contributor badge as part of their eligibility criteria for their own roles."

**Tracking Group State**

> "**Policy:** For each governing body or cell, these records will include:
>
> * The purpose of the group, including related agreements such as shared values and goals
> * All norms and practices agreed upon by the group
> * Definitions and locations of all information and platforms related to the activities and progress of the group"

**Community Oversight and Feedback**

> "**Policy:**
>
> * Operational Governance will publish yearly activity reports accessible to all community members
> * A dedicated feedback channel will be established in the discussion forum
> * Community members may propose specific agenda items for Operational Governance to consider
> * Operational Governance will host (at least) bi-monthly open sessions for community questions"

**Conflict Resolution**

> "**Policy:** In cases where the boundary between community and operational authority is unclear or disputed:
>
> 1. The issue will be documented and shared in both governance forums
> 2. A joint working group with equal representation from both governance bodies will convene
> 3. If consensus cannot be reached within 14 days, the matter defaults to community governance (or first the DAO Advisory Group, if it exists)
> 4. The resolution will be documented as a clarification to this policy"

#### Additional Required Policies

According to [AIFSIP-04](../../archive/proposals/epoch-2/aifsip-04-establish-operational-governance-domain.md), these additional policies must be created and used by Operational Governance:

* Cell Formation Process (Forthcoming)
* Operational Security Policy (Forthcoming)
* Financial Reporting Requirements (Forthcoming)
* Cell State Documentation Standards (Forthcoming)

_This section will be updated as operational policies are developed by the AIFS Operations Group._

## Transparency and Accountability

All operational policies are publicly available in this registry to ensure:

* Transparency in operational decision-making processes
* Accountability of operational teams to their commitments
* Accessibility of standards to all DAO participants
* Consistent application of operational principles across cells

Updates to operational policies are documented in the DAO State Changes registry.
