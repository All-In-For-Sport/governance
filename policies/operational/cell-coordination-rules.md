# Cell Coordination Rules

Cell Coordination Rules establish how operational cells organize, govern themselves, and collaborate within the AIFS ecosystem. These policies ensure that autonomous cells maintain alignment with AIFS values while having the freedom to pursue their initiatives effectively. They cover the structure of operational governance, requirements for new cells, transparency standards, and mechanisms for community engagement.

### Governance Structure

This section defines how the AIFS Operations Group is structured and how cells participate in operational decision-making. It establishes delegate selection, voting rights, and organizational boundaries.

**Policy:**

> Operational governance is autonomous within the constraints of AIFS policies and community agreements
>
> * Cells are autonomous over their own day-to-day operations within the same constraints
> * Operational governance will be carried out by delegates from each operational cell:
>   * No less than 3, and no more than 9 delegates will be active at any time
>   * Each cell selects one delegate to Operational Governance
>   * If there are less than 3 operational cells, each cell will select an additional delegate
>   * If there are more than 9 operational cells, Operational Governance must reorganize cells into sub-units
>   * Each cell has one vote in operational governance, regardless of the number of delegates

### Tracking Group State

These requirements ensure transparency by defining what information cells must document about their purpose and activities. Complete documentation helps maintain organizational coherence and facilitates collaboration.

**Policy:**

> For each governing body or cell, these records will include:
>
> * The purpose of the group, including related agreements such as shared values and goals
> * All norms and practices agreed upon by the group
> * Definitions and locations of all information and platforms related to the activities and progress of the group

### Cell Eligibility Requirements

These criteria outline what new cells must demonstrate to be recognized as part of the AIFS Operations Group. They ensure each cell has clear leadership, structure, and alignment with the broader DAO.

**Policy:**

> To establish an operational cell, proposals must include:
>
> * Identified project team members and/or onchain role badge(s)
>   * Identified delegate(s) who will participate in AIFS Operational Governance
> * Defined project structure and cell state, as required by the AIFS community
> * Governance framework for funds and operations (bylaws)
> * Clear indication of how the cell will help to support the DAO's administrative costs

### Compliance Mechanisms

This progressive review process balances autonomy with accountability for operational cells. It establishes clear steps for addressing non-compliance while prioritizing support over punitive measures.

**Policy:**

> Operational Governance will establish a yearly financial review process to ensure compliance:
>
> 1. Cells that fail to meet requirements will receive an initial review and support period
> 2. Continued non-compliance requires submission of a remediation plan
> 3. After two consecutive years of non-compliance, the cell's status may be reviewed
> 4. Persistent non-compliance may result in loss of AIFS brand usage rights

### Community Oversight and Feedback

These requirements establish regular communication channels between operational cells and the broader AIFS community. They ensure operational activities remain visible and responsive to community input.

**Policy:**

> Operational Governance will publish yearly activity reports accessible to all community members
>
> * A dedicated feedback channel will be established in the discussion forum
> * Community members may propose specific agenda items for Operational Governance to consider
> * Operational Governance will host (at least) bi-monthly open sessions for community questions
