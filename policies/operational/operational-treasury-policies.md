# Operational Treasury Policies

Operational Treasury & Security Policies govern the financial and security aspects of AIFS operations. These policies establish how operational funds are managed, how revenue is shared between cells and the broader DAO infrastructure, and how financial reporting is conducted. They also set expectations for security practices, outline contribution models for sustainable funding, and establish metrics for evaluating operational success.

### Operations Multisig

This defines the primary treasury infrastructure for operational activities and establishes security requirements. It ensures operational funds are managed separately from community governance with appropriate controls.

**Policy:**

> The designated smart contract for the AIFS Operations Group is a Safe Multisig located on Optimism at the address: `0xb4409fb4eA8374e2590266Bac51dF3F9756d1D51` - Each Operational Governance delegate must serve as a signer on the Safe - The security policy must require a majority of delegates to approve any transaction - Operational Governance will create an operational security policy within 6 months

### Contribution Framework

This framework establishes how operational cells contribute to shared infrastructure costs. It creates a sustainable funding model while maintaining flexibility for cells with limited resources.

**Policy:**

> Operational cells are strongly encouraged, but not required, to contribute 10% of their revenues to Operational Governance - This voluntary contribution supports DAO-wide administrative functions and infrastructure - Cells with limited resources may propose alternative contribution arrangements - The success of AIFS depends on cells voluntarily supporting shared infrastructure
>
> * Operational Governance will contribute to SuperBenefit as its facilitating organization:
>   * 50% of its revenue share from cells (this is revenue already contributed by cells, nominally 5% of total cell revenue)
>   * 5% of other revenues received directly by Operational Governance (such as grants or donations made directly to operations)
>   * A required 6% of total profits at the end of the year, as calculated according to the SuperBenefit P\&L statement

### Accounting Procedures

These financial record-keeping requirements ensure operational transparency and consistency. They establish standardized reporting practices while allowing cells to adapt templates to their specific needs.

**Policy:**

> Each operational cell will:
>
> * Maintain transparent financial records accessible to Operational Governance
> * Submit yearly financial reports including revenue and contribution calculations
> * Use and/or adapt standardized templates recommended by Operational Governance

### Success Metrics

These evaluation criteria establish how the effectiveness of the operational framework will be assessed. They combine quantitative and qualitative measures to provide a comprehensive view of operational performance.

**Policy:**

> This operational framework will be evaluated after 12 months based on:
>
> * Number of active operational cells
> * Total revenue generated by operational activities
> * Percentage of operational funding contributed to administration
> * Completion rate of stated operational goals
> * Community satisfaction as measured by feedback surveys
> * Timeliness of required reporting and transparency documents

### Clarification of Administrative Duties

This timeline requirement ensures the relationship between AIFS and SuperBenefit is formalized through proper governance channels. It includes an accountability mechanism through the expiration of delegated authorities.

**Policy:**

> SuperBenefit will submit a proposal to Community Governance within 12 months of AIFSIP-04, further clarifying its facilitation relationship with AIFS Operations Group. All delegated administrative authorities will be revoked if such a proposal is not approved within 24 months of AIFSIP-04.
