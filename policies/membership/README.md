# ü§ù Membership Agreements

These agreements govern the terms of membership and participation for all members of the DAO.

Agreements may be updated by submitting a Governance State Update Proposal. Please reach out to the [governance team](broken-reference) for assistance in creating your proposal.

### Membership Requirements

_<mark style="color:green;">TBD by Community</mark>_

#### Non-Discrimination Policy

All In For Sport does not discriminate on the basis of race, nationality, religion, age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, political affiliation, or otherwise.

### Membership Tokens

All In For Sport uses NFT membership badges to prove membership in the DAO and to provide governance rights to its members. These badges are _non-transferrable_ ERC-1155 tokens issued on Polygon Mainnet.&#x20;

* Membership Badge Contract: [0xeed76f3d0de104827357b37aa2f0ce3701e4ae28](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xeed76f3d0de104827357b37aa2f0ce3701e4ae28)

In order to comply with the terms of the DAO's UNA operating agreement, these badges are intended to be non-transferrable by any means. Attempting to transfer ownership of a badge (such as by sharing/selling a seed phrase) is not allowed and will immediately void your membership badge (and may result in a Guild Kick).

#### How to request a Membership Badge

<mark style="color:green;">Application Process TBD by community</mark>

By accepting a membership badge, you're agreeing to join the DAO and providing your consent to all of the agreements within this directory. You can read more about them below.

#### How to revoke your Membership Badge

<mark style="color:green;">Revocation Process TBD by community</mark>

By requesting the revocation of your membership badge, you're agreeing to leave the DAO and to dissociate yourself from the agreements in this directory. You relinquish all governance rights, but will still be entitled to claim any capital previously allocated to you within the DAO's designated smart contracts ("ragequit") if applicable.
