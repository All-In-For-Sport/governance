# Proposal 03: Implement governance structure for AIFS

Proposed by: @Rowan

[üó£Ô∏è Clarity](https://app.clarity.so/allinforsport/work/GEN-23)

**Submitted:** 11/28/2022\
**Result:** TBD ‚úÖ ‚ùå

### **Purpose**

AIFS is an attempt to create a genuinely community led DAO that can flexibly move based on direction from diverse members of our network.

As we start to take action we risk falling on one of two sides of the path we want to take.

* Either we don't have enough structure and we become a chaotic mess (especially as the volume of proposals greatly increases)
* Or we have too much structure and we stifle community participation with over-burdensome governance process.

The governance team are proposing putting together a minimal set of governance features that can help AIFS move forward quickly in our current early stage, but that can evolve into a more robust governance architecture as we grow and evolve and things like NFT minting,  sponsorship and community funding rounds become a reality.

### Design

We are proposing to implement:

1. Updated governance state on Github and Gitbook
2. Updated contributor badging to implement contributor earned governance
3. Simple proposal template/s to make it easier for community proposals to be written, improved and assessed by voters
4. Proposal voting via snapshot&#x20;
5. Multi-sig Safe to hold initial Krause contribution and future funding (selection of multi-sig holders will be an open process)

We will work towards setting up an Unincorporated, Non-profit Association (UNA) with a legal wrapper in time for the launch of the NFT mechanism but this will come in a later proposal when it is more fully developed.

### **Momentum**

The governance team has been working hard on getting these steps designed and are ready to implement them as soon as the proposal is passed. The governance team is also open to anyone in the community who wants to join.

### **Detail**

By voting **Agreeing** on this proposal in the Telegram poll you are approving the implementation of step 1-5 outlined in the **Design** section of this proposal.
