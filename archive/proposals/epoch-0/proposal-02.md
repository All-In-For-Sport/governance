# Proposal 02: Set up a Partnerships Team

**Proposed by:** @Shanny\_NFT#4955

[üó£Ô∏è **Clarity**](https://app.clarity.so/allinforsport/work/GEN-15)

**Submitted:** 11/02/2022\
**Result:** Passed ‚úÖ

## Background

This is one of two first proposals for AIFS as we bootstrap from a group of people who share an insight and passion for some ideas to a sophisticated flexible network DAO structure that can effectively govern itself across an infinite number of places and contexts.

We are basing this on a core governance principle - that direction comes from community proposals.

As we start this process we leverage the Fist-to-Five decision making method we already have agreed by the beginnings of our community.

This proposal is seeking endorsement from the early AIFS community to set up a team to pursue sponsorship and partnership opportunities of likeminded organizations with the goal that they will become early adopters and financial supporters of the DAO's vision.

This and the Governance team proposal can hopefully evolve into templates for how we set up proposals to the DAO in the future.

## Purpose

Creating a partnership cell allows those with a passion for building relationships to come together and identify key targets and potential early adopters in support of the AIFS mission.

## Design

We want to set up a partnership team within AIFS to hold conversations and make proposals about partnership opportunities as AIFS evolves into its future shape.

* The team will be set up with transparency built in. Anyone can see how we are making decisions and what we are working on at any time.
* The main goal is to set up space and a structure for focused work on AIFS partnerships. It will also be open for anyone in the network to come along and contribute to.
* And crucially, having this team doesn't stop anyone else in the AIFS network from developing different ideas and approaches for sponsorship and partnerships and proposing them to the community as well. All ideas are welcome.

## Momentum

* There is already good momentum around potential sponsor partnerships for AIFS. Conversations with Mario Lopes with Krause House DAO have also proven fruitful and opportunities with individual athletes, potential project partners and larger aligned groups in the space have all been identified as potentials. We have begun an initial mapping in the [AIFS Figjam](https://www.figma.com/file/eqV5QyRR6i32UFhUtItzGL/AIFS-Design-Jam?node-id=0%3A1) where we feel these alignments could be and identified initial targets.
* @Shanny\_NFT#4955 is committed to this work and the door is open for all interested to join.
* @Shanny\_NFT#4955 and @Lewwwk have produced a short audio pitch to be highlighted on the Green Pilled Podcast. We feel this has great potential not only to draw in supportive and interested builders, but to further investigate the opportunity to explore how we might integrate Gitcoin‚Äôs emerging quadratic funding infrastructure into our funding mechanisms.
* @Shanny\_NFT#4955 has applied for the Boys Club grants program. If won, this will give a small kickstart to our treasury but most importantly, could be an opportunity to bring Boys Club members perspective into the fold. It could also be a media connect as Boys Club is building out Boys Club Consulting which is a web3 brand strategy consultancy firm.
* @Shanny\_NFT#4955 has had warm intro to the Gitcoin Grants lead - Nate - from Kevin Owocki. Hopes are to set up a call to understand where quadratic funding can support our goals as well as use cases for modular protocols such as zk or maci.

#### First Steps

* Put out a call to the people already involved in AIFS conversations to pull in interested contributors.
* Pull together a 1-page document that is shareable with our targets. Begin initial conversations with these targets to gauge interest and alignment.

#### Details

* Please respond to the Fist-to-Five on this proposal in the AIFS Telegram.
