## Summary

This proposal seeks to establish a formal separation between community governance and operational activities within All In For Sport. By distinguishing these domains of authority, we create a framework allowing autonomous operational cells to function under the AIFS brand while maintaining alignment with our purpose. Community governance retains stewardship over the DAO's mission and brand identity.

### Glossary

**UNA/TUNAA**: Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Agreement\
**Cell**: Autonomous workgroup within the DAO structure\
**SuperBenefit**: Partner organization providing administrative support for AIFS operational activities

## Details

AIFSIP-04 establishes a practical framework to separate decision-making within AIFS into two complementary domains: community governance and operational execution. Community governance will focus on mission, purpose, and brand stewardship, while operational teams gain the autonomy needed to execute projects effectively. This structure implements the two-house governance model outlined in our DAO Overview.

The separation solves key challenges we've faced in day-to-day operations by allowing specialized teams to move quickly on opportunities while ensuring accountability to our broader community. It establishes clear boundaries of authority, transparent reporting requirements, and sustainable funding mechanisms that benefit the entire ecosystem.

#### Background and Context

This proposal represents a critical step in AIFS's governance evolution from a single-house to a two-house model. Since our founding, we've operated primarily through community governance, which has provided strong alignment but sometimes limited our ability to execute quickly on operational opportunities.

As outlined in our DAO Overview document, AIFS envisions a "centerless network" structure where autonomous cells can operate within a shared cultural container. AIFSIP-04 provides the formal framework to implement this vision, creating clear boundaries between strategic oversight and operational execution while maintaining the cultural alignment that defines our community.

#### Implementation Approach

Implementation of AIFSIP-04 proceeds with the following key milestones and deadlines:

1. **Operational Governance Domain**: Established immediately upon proposal approval, with all required documentation completed within 6 months.
2. **AIFS Operations Group**: Begins operating immediately upon approval, with the operational security policy developed within 6 months. A new governance contract will be selected and proposed for community approval by month 16.
3. **AIFS-SuperBenefit Partnership**: SuperBenefit submits a detailed proposal to community governance within 12 months to formalize its facilitation relationship with the AIFS Operations Group.

All delegated authorities under this proposal expire 24 months after approval unless renewed through a new community governance proposal.

## Proposed Actions

If this proposal passes, the following actions will be taken:

1. The operational policy domain will be formally established and documented in the DAO State, with clear boundaries between community and operational governance
2. The AIFS Operations Group will be recognized as the operational governance body with authority to coordinate operational cells
3. The Operations Multisig (`0xb4409fb4eA8374e2590266Bac51dF3F9756d1D51`) will be established as the official operational treasury on Optimism
4. SuperBenefit will be recognized as the administrative support organization for operational activities
5. The funding model will be implemented, with contribution requirements as specified
6. Required documentation for operational governance and cells will be published within the timeframes specified
7. Quarterly reporting and community feedback mechanisms will be established
8. A comprehensive review of this framework will occur 18 months after implementation
