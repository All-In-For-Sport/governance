## Summary

This proposal seeks to establish membership requirements for All In For Sport DAO as a basis for granting DAO membership (with governance authority) to its community members. In addition, this proposal seeks to establish basic guidelines (our Shared Values and Commitment to Accountability) for participation in the DAO.

## Membership Requirements

We propose the addition of the following membership eligibility criteria to the [Membership Requirements](https://state.allinforsport.org/policies/membership#membership-requirements) section of the [AIFS Membership Agreements](https://state.allinforsport.org/policies/membership):

- Members must be over the age of 18 years, and legally qualified to accept the [Membership Agreements](https://state.allinforsport.org/policies/membership).
- Prospective members will be required to acknowledge acceptance of all membership agreements and community guidelines prior to receiving a membership badge.
- Members will obtain a Member Badge and hold it in a public Ethereum address.

## Community Guidelines

We propose the addition of the following Community Guidelines to the [DAO State](https://state.allinforsport.org/). These guidelines have been co-created by the All In For Sport community to reflect the shared values and mutual commitments we adhere to in our participation in All In For Sport.

### Shared Values

These are the values to which we hold ourselves in our fulfillment of All In For Sport's purpose, in our participation in the DAO and its community, and in collaboration with partners, allies and others with whom we share space.

#### We Empower Grassroots Sports Movements

Because the best solutions come from the ground up, we empower grassroots movements who are already doing great work in their communities. We respect and trust that communities know best what they need, and we build relationships with partners, sponsors and peers who share this commitment.

#### We Invite Collaboration and Collective Ownership

From the DAO to the court down the street, collective ownership and collective responsibility are at our core. We work together to co-create shared space in which all members can meaningfully participate, share their skills, honor their commitments and trust others to do the same.

#### We Challenge Ourselves and Existing Structures of Power

We seek innovative ways to distribute ownership and responsibility of sports infrastructure in order to maximize community benefit, equity, and impact. We respectfully challenge ourselves and one another to disrupt existing systems and power structures, and actively consider and reflect on how we embody this commitment in our individual and collective actions.

### Commitment to Accountability

All In For Sport is dedicated to advancing empowerment and inclusion through sport. For us, this includes people and communities of every ethnicity, faith, religion, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, mental health, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, age, disability, Indigenous status, and level of experience.

AIFS members commit to fostering an encouraging, safe and community driven environment for all that is free from harassment and harm. The AIFS members will strive to uphold the values [INSERT link] and show up as their best selves and in the best interest of the mission and collective. This is not an exhaustive list of examples below but it is intended to outline the spirit of intention for a code of conduct for AIFS.

#### Examples of encouraged behavior by members

- Being kind, encouraging and courteous to others
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
- Acknowledging preferred gender pronouns
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Collaborating with other community members, stakeholders and partners
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Welcoming the unknown, ambiguity and possibility
- Showing up with humility
- Reflecting on where bias and Intersecting power dynamics may be showing up
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- If you see something, say something
- Approaching and listening to others and leading with empathy

#### Examples of unacceptable behavior by members

- Implicitly or explicitly offensive comments related to race, ethnicity, faith, religion, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, mental health, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, age, disability, Indigenous status, and level of experience.
- Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices, practices and request for anonymity
- Disregarding preferred gender pronouns
- Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or messages, including the use of explicit or violent sexual language colloquially
- Threats or incitement of violence of any kind
- Deliberate intimidation
- Unwelcome sexual attention and comments
- Sustained disruption of discussion
- Harassment, including persistent attempts to communicate with someone (publicly or privately) after requests are ignored or otherwise declined
- Publication of non-harassing private communication (e.g. screenshots of personal exchanges) or private personal information (e.g. name, location, identifying details)
- Harassing other community members in public or private channels
- Disregarding requests or warnings from community members
- Engaging in other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

#### Attribution

## Proposed Outcome

**If this proposal passes, the following will occur:**

- The policies put forth in this proposal will be ratified and included in the DAO State.
- Requirements and guidelines for participation will be posted in all group communication channels.
- A new membership badge contract will be chosen, and will include a "Member" badge to serve the governance role of "Cryptographic Units" (voting tokens) as defined in the [Operating Agreement](https://state.allinforsport.org/policies/membership/operating-agreement).
- All current members of the Discord and Telegram chat groups will be offered an opportunity to claim a Member badge.
