# üîè DAO State Repository

The All In For Sport governance state repository is a resource for information related to governance activity, agreements and norms within the DAO. This library was built to provide a central source of truth, and to empower all DAO members with a way to directly affect DAO governance by proposing new initiatives, working groups and policies.

### About AIFS Governance

All In for Sport uses a decentralized organizational structure and an experimental, polycentric governance process designed to enable truly community-driven stewardship of the DAO's treasury while also providing high-context, agile governance of the DAO's operational functions.

You can learn more about All In For Sport's governance process on the [Governance Overview](state/) page.  Governance principles and design notes can be found [here](https://app.clarity.so/allinforsport/docs/e5eb6015-e824-42a0-86d0-55293da514ab).

### [Metagovernance](broken-reference)

The "Metagovernance" category provides the foundational overview of AIFS's governance structure and processes. It outlines how the DAO is organized, how decisions are made, and how different governance domains interact.

This section includes:

* DAO Overview - The fundamental structure and purpose of AIFS governance
* Community Governance - The processes and frameworks for community-driven decision making

This section is updated by the Governance Cell when changes to the core governance model are approved through Community Governance.

### [Agreements](./#agreement)

The "Agreements" category contains the binding agreements that establish the legal structure and member obligations within AIFS's multicameral governance system. The purpose of this section is to provide a clear record of the commitments made by participants in different governance domains.

This section can only be updated through governance processes specific to each type of agreement, with Community Governance agreements requiring proposal approval by the DAO.

### [Policies](broken-reference)

The "Policies" category contains the standards and procedures that govern activities across AIFS. The purpose of this section is to ensure consistent decision-making and operational practices throughout the DAO.

This section is maintained by delegated governance entities within parameters established by Community Governance.

### [Archives](broken-reference)

The "[Archives](broken-reference)" category contains records of past governance activity and retired articles. The purpose of this section is to provide an accessible, expanded reference for proposals, policies and other documents which might otherwise be spread across multiple sources and data silos.

This section is updated as needed by the governance team as new proposals are created and corresponding governance state updates are made.
