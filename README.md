# üîè DAO State Repository

The All In For Sport governance state repository is a resource for information related to governance activity, agreements and norms within the DAO. This library was built to provide a central source of truth, and to empower all DAO members with a way to directly affect DAO governance by proposing new initiatives, working groups and policies.

### About AIFS Governance

All In for Sport uses a decentralized organizational structure and an experimental, polycentric governance process designed to enable truly community-driven stewardship of the DAO's treasury while also providing high-context, agile governance of the DAO's operational functions.

You can learn more about All In For Sport's governance process on the [Governance Overview](dao/overview.md) page.  Governance principles and design notes can be found [here](https://app.clarity.so/allinforsport/docs/e5eb6015-e824-42a0-86d0-55293da514ab).

### [Organization](broken-reference)

The "[Organization](broken-reference)" category contains information related to roles, working groups, permissions and treasury activity. The purpose of this section is to provide transparency for DAO operations and to help members understand roles and permissions within the organization.

This section is updated by operators and governance stewards as needed to include new roles and working groups, to indicate administrators of DAO assets (governance tooling, socials, coordination platforms, etc.).

### [Policies](broken-reference)

The "[Policies](broken-reference)" category contains the agreements and standards to which all DAO members are held. The purpose of this section is to help members understand and consent to the cultural norms and operating agreements we share.

This section can only be updated by submitting a [governance state proposal](policies/proposals/metagovernance.md) for vote by the DAO.

### [Archives](broken-reference)

The "[Archives](broken-reference)" category contains records of past governance activity and retired articles. The purpose of this section is to provide an accessible, expanded reference for proposals, policies and other documents which might otherwise be spread across multiple sources and data siloes.

This section is updated as needed by the governance team as new proposals are created and corresponding governance state updates are made.

## About This Repository

This Governance State Repository is maintained by the Governance Workgroup (or "[Governance CELL](broken-reference)") to provide a central source of truth for governance activity, transaction approvals, policies and other governance-related information.

The governance state is version controlled and hosted publicly on [GitHub](https://github.com/All-In-For-Sport/governance). The current version is hosted on GitBook, and can be found at [https://governance.allinforsport.org/](https://governance.allinforsport.org/).&#x20;
