# ü§ù Agreement Registry

This registry contains all active agreements that govern participation in All In For Sport DAO. Different agreements may apply to different roles and contexts within the DAO, with membership agreements being the baseline for all members.

### Purpose

The purpose of this registry is to:

* Provide a single source of truth for all agreements across AIFS's multicameral governance system
* Document agreements specific to each governance domain (Community Governance, Operational Governance, etc.)
* Ensure transparency about obligations and rights within each governance domain
* Establish clear expectations for participation in various DAO activities
* Create a foundation for the legal and social operation of the DAO's governance domains

### Operating Agreement

All In For Sport employs a multicameral governance system with distinct governance domains. The [Trustless Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Agreement ("TUNAA")](https://de.una.ricardian.eth.limo/) specifically governs the Community Governance domain of AIFS. It establishes the legal structure for community decision-making and differentiates between DAO treasury holdings and the financial activities of individual participants.

The TUNAA does not govern other governance domains such as Operational Governance, which functions through a network of autonomous working groups (CELLS) using a sociocratic governance model. The highest level "CELL of CELLS" serves as the DAO Advisory Group for purposes specified in the TUNAA, but this role is limited to interactions between Operational Governance and Community Governance.

By participating in Community Governance and/or holding membership tokens ("badges"), you signal your consent to this agreement as it applies to the Community Governance domain.

* Operating Agreement - Outlines the purpose, goals, and legal structure of Community Governance within AIFS

### Membership Agreements

Agreements governing the requirements and expectations for DAO membership:

* Membership Requirements - Eligibility criteria for DAO membership
* Shared Values - The values to which all members hold themselves in fulfilling AIFS's purpose
* Commitment to Accountability - Guidelines for respectful and constructive participation

### Agreement Updates

Updates to agreements in this registry follow different processes depending on which governance domain they belong to:

* **Community Governance Agreements**: Must be approved through a State Update Proposal voted on by Community Governance.
* **Operating Agreement (TUNAA)**: Requires both approval by Community Governance AND additional approval by the DAO Advisory Group per the State Update Policy.
* **Operational Governance Agreements**: Follow the decision-making processes established within Operational Governance, typically through the relevant CELL or CELL of CELLS structures.

By accepting a membership badge, you agree to be bound by the membership agreements in this registry that apply to your role. Additional agreements may apply based on your specific involvement in DAO activities. All agreements are subject to updates through proper governance procedures.
