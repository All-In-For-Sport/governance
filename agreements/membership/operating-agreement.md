# UNA Operating Agreement

### Purpose

All In For Sport is an experiment **to bring together diverse communities in web3 and sports to partner in developing a perpetual funding mechanism for community initiatives that advance inclusion and empowerment through sport around the world**.

### Goals

Our ultimate goal is to establish a perpetual funding mechanism dedicated to community-directed funding for inclusion and empowerment through sport. For this project, we aim to convene diverse communities across web3 and sports to co-design this mechanism and support its development in a way that demonstrates what web3 can bring to sports and inclusion.

#### Current Milestone & Goals

* [Launch the All In For Sport NFT protocol and perpetual funding mechanism](https://app.clarity.so/allinforsport/roadmap)

In order to reach this milestone, the following goals must be achieved:

* [Establish Self-Management Foundations for AIFS](https://app.clarity.so/allinforsport/project/3)
* [Launch a Perpetual Funding Mechanism](https://app.clarity.so/allinforsport/project/7)

All proposals and initiatives should include a clearly stated goal and must work toward achieving the current milestone in a meaningful way. Members are encouraged to reject proposals which do not contribute to the achievement of a specified goal.

## Ricardian NFT

All In For Sport (referred to in this documentation as the "DAO") uses the [Trustless Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Agreement ("TUNAA")](https://de.una.ricardian.eth.limo/) as its basis for self-governance, and to differentiate between DAO treasury holdings and the financial activities of its individual participants. By joining the DAO and/or holding its membership tokens ("badges"), you signal your consent to this agreement and any others defined within this directory.&#x20;

The Trustless UNA Agreement does not represent a business partnership, nor does it imply the existence of a registered legal entity or tax-exempt status. However, the agreement does provide a basis from which the DAO can create a legal entity or seek tax-exempt status (or other tax election) in the future.

This operating agreement concerns only the DAO treasury as a siloed entity, independent from community or operational governance bodies or any agreements which govern them. The "TUNAA" is a static document which is recorded in the DAO treasury wallet as a [Ricardian NFT](https://docs.wrappr.wtf/get-started/what/). The agreement may only be altered or revoked via a [DAO state update proposal](../../policies/governance/proposals/metagovernance.md) and with consent of the DAO Advisory Group (A.K.A. "Operational Governance" or "OpGov").

**By ratifying this DAO state document and/or joining the DAO, consenting to the Trustless Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Agreement and its terms. You may dissociate yourself from this agreement by leaving the DAO.**
