# Shared Values

These are the values to which we hold ourselves in our fulfillment of All In For Sport's purpose, in our participation in the DAO and its community, and in collaboration with partners, allies and others with whom we share space.

## We Empower Grassroots Sports Movements

Because the best solutions come from the ground up, we empower grassroots movements who are already doing great work in their communities. We respect and trust that communities know best what they need, and we build relationships with partners, sponsors and peers who share this commitment.

## We Invite Collaboration and Collective Ownership

From the DAO to the court down the street, collective ownership and collective responsibility are at our core. We work together to co-create shared space in which all members can meaningfully participate, share their skills, honor their commitments and trust others to do the same.

## We Challenge Ourselves and Existing Structures of Power

We seek innovative ways to distribute ownership and responsibility of sports infrastructure in order to maximize community benefit, equity, and impact. We respectfully challenge ourselves and one another to disrupt existing systems and power structures, and actively consider and reflect on how we embody this commitment in our individual and collective actions.
