# Operational Governance

Operational Governance functions through the AIFS Operations Group, which coordinates autonomous cells and manages shared operational resources.

This page describes the formal operational governance structure of All In For Sport. Established through AIFSIP-04, Operational Governance focuses on efficient execution of projects aligned with our shared purpose while maintaining autonomy over day-to-day activities.

## Purpose

Operational Governance exists to enable efficient execution of initiatives that advance our shared mission: **bringing together diverse communities in web3 and sports to develop a perpetual funding mechanism for initiatives that advance inclusion and empowerment through sport worldwide.**

We do this by:

* Creating autonomous cells that can quickly pursue opportunities aligned with our mission
* Coordinating resources and expertise across operational teams
* Managing operational funds separate from the main community treasury
* Ensuring transparent communication with the broader community
* Maintaining alignment with the values and purpose established by Community Governance

***

## Common Practices

Operational Governance exists to enable effective execution of initiatives that advance our shared mission, while maintaining alignment with the values and purpose established by Community Governance. The Operations domain focuses on implementation rather than direction-setting, allowing specialized teams to move quickly on opportunities within boundaries established by the community.

The relationship between Operational and Community Governance is complementary â€“ Community Governance stewards our mission and identity, while Operational Governance brings our purpose to life through concrete actions and projects.

### Structure and Organization

Operational activities at All In For Sport are carried out by autonomous workgroups called "cells" that coordinate through the AIFS Operations Group. This structure implements the "CELL of CELLs" concept referenced throughout our documentation.

The **AIFS Operations Group** serves as the coordinating body for operational activities, bringing together delegates from each operational cell. This group manages shared operational resources and ensures alignment across projects while respecting the autonomy of individual cells.

**Operational cells** are autonomous workgroups that carry out specific projects and initiatives. Each cell maintains its own internal governance while sending delegates to participate in the broader Operations Group.

### Key Resources

The operational governance structure is supported by:

* **Operations Multisig**: `0xb4409fb4eA8374e2590266Bac51dF3F9756d1D51` (Optimism)
* **Role Badges**: [AIFS Operations Group Badge](https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/trees/10/78?hatId=78.3) and [AIFS Contributor Badge](https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/trees/10/78?hatId=78.1.6)
* **Administrative Support**: Provided by [SuperBenefit](https://superbenefit.org/)

#### Documentation and Policies

Operational policies and procedures are documented in the Operational Policies section of the DAO State. These include guidelines for cell formation, financial management, and compliance with community agreements.

### Decision-Making

Decision-making within Operational Governance follows these principles:

* **Cell Autonomy**: Cells make independent decisions about their internal operations
* **Coordination**: The Operations Group coordinates resources and cross-cell initiatives
* **Boundaries**: All operational activities respect the constraints established by Community Governance

## Progress

### Activity Tracking

Progress in the operational domain is tracked through:

* Regular reporting to both the Operations Group and Community Governance
* Transparent documentation of activities and outcomes
* Financial reporting and contribution tracking

#### Current Initiatives

_This section will be updated as operational cells are formally established._

### Evaluation Framework

The effectiveness of the operational governance structure will be evaluated through:

* Periodic reviews of the framework (first major review 18 months after implementation)
* Success metrics tracking operational activity and community satisfaction
* Transparent reporting to the broader community

The Operations Group maintains responsibility for tracking progress and reporting to Community Governance in accordance with the principles established in AIFSIP-04.
