# Community Governance

This page describes how community members participate in governing All In For Sport. As one of the two houses in AIFS's governance structure, Community Governance focuses on protecting our purpose, overseeing treasury decisions, and stewarding the agreements which unite our community.

## Purpose

At its heart, Community Governance exists to protect and evolve our shared purpose: **bringing together diverse communities in web3 and sports to develop a perpetual funding mechanism for initiatives that advance inclusion and empowerment through sport worldwide.**

We do this by:

* Making sure all AIFS activities align with our mission
* Safeguarding our core values and agreements
* Evolving our policies based on community input
* Overseeing the treasury and approving funding for operational work
* Creating space for broad participation in decision-making
* Maintaining our legal structure (UNA) that provides liability protection for members

***

## Common Practices

Our community is made up of members who hold non-transferable membership badges. Anyone agrees to our membership agreements can join. We're committed to non-discrimination and welcome diverse participation from anyone aligned with our shared values.

Important to know:

* Members aren't agents of the DAO and can't bind it to any obligations
* Members aren't personally liable for DAO obligations
* Members who violate our community standards may have their membership revoked through a "Guild Kick" process

### How Decisions are Made

Our governance process is designed to be accessible and transparent:

1. **Leadership Structure**\
   The operating agreement provides for a "DAO Advisory Group" to interpret governance questions. While not yet established, this group will serve as a governance backstop and policy administrator within Community Governance.
2. **Proposal Journey**\
   Any member can create a proposal following our standards. We've designed a simple process:
   * Draft proposals are shared for community feedback
   * After incorporating input, proposals move to formal voting
   * Voting happens on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/allinforsport.eth) with clear thresholds for passage
   * Approved changes are implemented and documented

For details on proposal requirements and voting thresholds, check out our proposal standards and voting policies.

## Progress Tracking

### Our Governance Journey

Community Governance at AIFS has evolved through several phases:

1. **Beginnings (Epoch 0)**\
   We started with informal working groups and Telegram-based voting. This early period established our foundation through grassroots organization.
2. **Formalization (Epoch 1)**\
   We created our formal structure through AIFSIP-01, establishing ourselves as a UNA with proper infrastructure for governance.
3. **Where We Are Now**\
   We're developing comprehensive membership guidelines and governance processes that balance community input with efficient decision-making.

### Treasury Oversight

We track all treasury activity transparently onchain, with separate logs for Ethereum and Polygon transactions.

Should the DAO ever dissolve, or break from its UNA agreement, our operating agreement requires that any remaining funds be donated to a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization.

### Looking Forward

We're working toward:

* Getting more members involved in proposal development
* Improving education about our governance processes
* Refining how Community and Operational Governance work together
* Building the perpetual funding mechanism at the heart of our mission
* Creating sustainable governance that can grow with us
